 <section id ="sheath">
  <p class = "sheath_id"><b> Sheath Dress </b>features a silhouette that fits close to the body and can have a hemline that hits      anywhere from mid-thigh to mid-calf.The neckline can vary, but a fitted waist is the focal point of this      type of dress. Sheaths are also often sleeveless and when they are longer than mid-thigh a slit up the      back makes it easier to walk in.Because of its rather broad definition, the sheath dress can take on      many  forms and can also be dressy or casual, depending on the fabric and cut. Shorter sheath dresses        are    great     for parties and cocktail events, while a longer sheath in a more conservative cut is a       staple     for the office.<br><br>Sheath dresses were popularized by American designers like <i><b>      Narciso   Rodriguez, Donna Karan and Ralph Lauren </b> </i> who favored minimal, uncomplicated designs in     the 1990s, but the style has roots as an undergarment going as far back as the early 1900s.<br> <br>First     Lady <b>Michelle Obama</b>, First Lady <b>Jackie Kennedy </b> and <b>Catherine</b>, Duchess of Cambridge      are all known for their wearing of sheath dresses.<br>

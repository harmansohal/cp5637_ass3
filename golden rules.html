         <li><b>Complement</b> your personal colouring, which is based on your dominant colour (eye, hair and skin colour). </li>
         
         <li>Dress according to your body shape, proportion and scale - it is important to understand how to dress to your build in order to create the appearance of a balanced body. </li>
         
          <li>Dress appropriate for the <i>occasion</i> - learn the know how to get it right for each occasion no  matter how varied they might be. </li>
          
          <li>Dress for your personality, in a way which reflects your lifestyle and character at work and  play. It is your personality which will put an outfit and look together. </li>
          
          <li>Look current - make sure that your outfit does not look dated in fabrics, cuts and accessories. Nothing is more aging and draining than wearing clothes which look out of fashion. Make sure  that your investment buys have a timeless look and feel, so you can jazz them up for the  occasion and adapt them to current fashion trends.</li>
